# Ballots

**Sponsoring:** To enter the Swarm Network Voting Queue, a GAP needs to be balloted. Any Member may sponsor a ballot by staking a minimum of **two hundred and fifty \(250\) SWM** tokens, becoming the “Ballot Sponsor.” GAPs that have been balloted are “Governance Action Ballots” or “GABs.” Any Member may petition the Swarm Council to sponsor a GAP.

**Seconding:** While a GAB is in the voting queue any Member may second the GAB any number of times by adding additional deposits of SWM tokens. A member that seconds a GAB is a “Ballot Supporter.”

**Elevation:** Every two months the GABs in the voting queue with the five greatest GAB stakes are elevated for a referendum. The Swarm Council determines, by a majority vote, if any elevated GABs present conflicting actions. In this case, only the GAB with the greatest GAB stake shall be elevated to a referendum. GABs have three voting intervals \(six months\) to be elevated to a referendum, at which time they are removed from the voting queue.

**What happens to stakes:** SWM tokens that have been staked to a GAB by sponsors and supporters constitute the “GAB stake.” Stakes associated with winning GABs are locked for **fifteen \(15\) days** after their vote, and then returned to the Ballot Sponsors and Ballot Supporters. The stakes of any failed GABs are forfeited to the Swarm Treasury.
