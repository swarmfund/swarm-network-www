# SWM Staking

## Pool 1 vs. Pool 2

There are two staking pools available. You can choose to stake your SWM by locking it away and enabling your participation in network governance while earning rewards, or you can provide liquidity to SWM on Uniswap and stake your LP token while also participating in network governance and earning rewards.

10 million initial SWM token reward pool was established 1 September 2018. 

Initial pool was 2.5 million, reducing by 25% each year, for 100 years. 

Rewards are distributed on the first of every month. 

**Pool 1, SWM Pool Rewards: 1x Rewards**

**Pool 2, SWM/ETH Pool Rewards: 4x Rewards**

**80% of fees paid in SWM are distributed to P1 and P2**
