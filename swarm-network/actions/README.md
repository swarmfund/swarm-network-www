# Initiating Governance Actions

Governance Actions direct the Swarm Council, Members, Designated Members, Participants or other third parties to perform certain tasks or activities for the benefit of the Swarm Network.

Governance Actions shall be decided by referendum. Approved actions are reviewed by the Swarm Council, which puts in place any procedures, or takes the necessary actions to execute them.

No Governance Action shall violate the Purposes of the Swarm Network or the laws of any applicable jurisdiction.

Governance Actions approved by Swarm Members in a referendum are placed in the [Governance Actions](https://github.com/swarmfund/networkgovernance/tree/master/Governance%20Actions) repository for archival purposes.
