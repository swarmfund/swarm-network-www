# Introduction

* Swarm Network Governance consists of three components: Proposals, Ballots and Actions.
* Any member can initiate a proposal.
* To promote a proposal to a ballot and be eligible to enter the voting queue, the ballot sponsor must deposit a stake of SWM tokens. Other Members can co-sponsor the ballot by staking additional SWM, which gives the ballot a higher priority.
