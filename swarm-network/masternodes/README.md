# Masternodes

A masternode is a compute resource that meets the minimum technical and network requirements to run the SWARM core software and validate transactions. As the network grows over time, masternodes will also provide resources for other data services relevant to the network.

Some key aspects about Masternodes:

* In order to activate a node as a SWARM Masternode, operators are required to stake 50,000 SWM tokens
* The masternode begins earning rewards 15 days after staking and activation
* Masternodes are required to run the latest release software version in order to receive rewards
* The Swarm Network has set aside 10 million SWM tokens as rewards for Masternodes maintaining the network
