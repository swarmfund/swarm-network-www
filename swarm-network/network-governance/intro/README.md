# Governance Action Voting Process

## Introduction

* Every two months, the five most supported ballots are voted on by eligible members in a referendum.
* Each SWM token grants its holder the right to cast one vote in any referendum.
* Liquid Democracy: Votes can be delegated to others.
* Winning ballots become actions to be executed by the Swarm Council.
