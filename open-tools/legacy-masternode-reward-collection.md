# Legacy Masternode Reward Collection

Gas prices were too high to continue Masternode reward distribution. We've moved the legacy reward claim to the xDai network.

All rewards prior to July, 2020 are on Ethereum Mainnet.

All rewards after July, 2020 are on xDai network. 

We've built a UI to claim **all** rewards from Ethereum Mainnet and xDai: [**https://collect.myswarm.app/**](https://collect.myswarm.app/)\*\*\*\*

**Tip:** If you are claiming rewards from multiple masternodes on xDai, combine them into a single wallet while on xDai so you only have to pay Gas fees to bridge back to Ethereum Mainnet one time.
