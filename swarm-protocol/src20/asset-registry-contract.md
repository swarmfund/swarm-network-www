# Asset Registry Contract

* **Smart Contract:** globally across all SRC20
* **Created:** pre-exists / created only once
* **Purpose:** Registry of asset data for all SRC20 tokens (meta data, esp. NAV)
* **Example:**  [On Ropsten](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x54f9b26edc46bd4beaf70ab2771b7ec178241932#code)  

## Feature Description

**Glossary**

| Item | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| KYA (Know Your Asset) | The intent of KYA is to create cryptographically-proven single-source-of-truth for metadata of a specific SRC20 and the asset it represents; token issuers can add and update dozens of parameters and attributes of their project, store them on a URL or IPFS file; this allows investors to have unfettered access to a full history of data change over the life-cycle of the token |
| NAV (NetAssetValue) | NAV describes the value of the asset which is tokenized by a specific SRC20; itâ€™s a common value in capital markets to describe the value of an asset and is based on underlying reports and assessments about the asset; as NAV represents the value of assets on the Swarm network it is used as the key value to determine the required SWM staking amounts for each SRC20 token |
